"A cool animation" -somebody

Made with [SFML 2.5](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5). Install SFML with:
```
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```
[Commands for compiling](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-linux.php) are in the makefile. Although note that this will NOT [link it statically](https://www.sfml-dev.org/faq.php#build-link-static)

Build and run using: (respectively)
```
make exe
./exe
```
(in the repo directory)
or the equivalent
```
make run
```
If you want to download and run the executable in this repo directly (do you trust me? >:) ) you will need to [set permissions for this file to be executed](https://askubuntu.com/questions/229589/how-to-make-a-file-e-g-a-sh-script-executable-so-it-can-be-run-from-a-termi/485001#485001)
